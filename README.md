[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This is a simple web page written in React for looking up Persona 5 items. It currently features tables for shop inventories, persona itemizations, gift items. It is deployed on github [here](https://quan.github.io/persona5_items/).

### Shopping

Unlike earlier Persona games, Persona 5 features multiple shops across multiple locations that each feature a unique set of items. In addition, most shops have special items that they will only sell under certain circumstances such as seasonal items and rainy day specials. Paying attention to these rotating stocks will help you get the most of your money.

### Itemization

On August 1 you will unlock the Electric Chair, a new execution in the Velvet Room. It provides you the option of sacrificing some of your Personas in exchange for items or skill cards. You can only perform one execution a day, so plan accordingly.
When using the Electric Chair, you will also need a base material such as the *Black Kogatana* for weapons, *Black Robe* for protectors, *Model Gun* for guns, and *Blank Card* for skill cards.

### Gift Items

Sometimes spending time with a Confidants will not level up your relationship. At the end of these dates you have the option of giving your Confidant a gift to further boost your relationship. Each Confidant has different gift preferences and may receive +3, +2, or +0 points when gifted a particular item. Keep in mind that each Gift can only be purchased once in a single playthrough.
