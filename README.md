## Persona 5 Item Database

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This is a database app for looking up Persona 5 items with current support for persona itemizations and gift items. It is deployed on github [here](https://quan.github.io/persona5_items/).

### Itemization

Beginning August 1, you can kill some of your Personas in an Electric Chair in exchange for items or skill cards. However, you can only do this once a day, so plan accordingly.
When using the electric chair execution, you also need a base material such as the *Black Kogatana* for weapons, *Black Robe* for protectors, *Model Gun* for guns, and *Blank Cards* for skill cards.

### Gift Items
Sometimes spending time with a Confidants will not level up your relationship. At the end of these dates you have the option of giving your Confidant a gift to further boost your relationship. Each Confidant has different gift preferences and may receive +3, +2, or +0 points when gifted a particular item. Keep in mind that each Gift can only be purchased once in a single playthrough.
