This is a database app for looking up Persona 5 items with current support for persona itemizations and gift items. It is deployed on github [here](https://quan.github.io/persona5_items/).

### Itemization

Beginning August 1, you can kill some of your Personas in an Electric Chair in exchange for items or skill cards. However when you do so, you can only do this once a day. Also when using the electric chair execution, you also need a base material such as the Black Kogatana, Black Robe, or the Model Gun. For skill cards, youâ€™ll need Blank Cards which you can find lying around Mementos. [[Source](https://samurai-gamers.com/persona-5/item-skill-conversion-electric-chair/)]

### Gift Items
Sometimes spending time with a Confidants will not level up your relationship. At the end of these dates you have the option of giving your Confidant a gift to further boost your relationship. Each Confidant has different gift preferences and may receive +3, +2, or +0 points when gifted a particular item. Keep in ming that, each Gift can only be purchased once in a single playthrough.
